                    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Our Story</h3>
                    <p class="lead">My name is Lisa Kumar, and I'm raising funds to help my brother, Raj, receive life-saving dialysis treatment while he waits for a kidney transplant.</p>
                    
                    <p>Raj is only 38 years old and was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) six months ago after battling Type 1 diabetes for over 20 years. Despite following his treatment plan diligently, his kidneys progressively deteriorated until they could no longer function on their own.</p>
                    
                    <p>Raj is a software engineer at a Seattle-based startup and a single father to his 10-year-old daughter, Maya. He's always been the strong, reliable big brother—the person our entire family turns to for support and guidance. Watching him struggle with this disease has been heartbreaking.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">The Daily Battle</h4>
                    <p>Raj needs hemodialysis three times per week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday—for four hours each session. During these treatments, his blood is filtered through a machine that removes waste and excess fluid his kidneys can no longer process. Without dialysis, toxins would build up in his body, leading to organ failure and death within weeks.</p>
                    
                    <p>While Raj is on the kidney transplant waiting list, the average wait time is 3-5 years. He must continue dialysis treatments during this entire period to stay alive. Each dialysis session costs approximately $400-500, and despite having insurance, the out-of-pocket expenses are crushing our family financially.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">The Financial Crisis</h4>
                    <p>We're raising $30,000 to cover six months of dialysis treatment costs, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>156 dialysis sessions (3x per week for 6 months)</li>
                        <li>Specialized medications (immunosuppressants, vitamins, EPO injections)</li>
                        <li>Blood work and monthly lab tests</li>
                        <li>Transportation to and from the dialysis center</li>
                        <li>Special renal diet requirements</li>
                        <li>Vascular access maintenance and care</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Raj has already exhausted his savings paying for the first few months of treatment. He's at risk of missing sessions, which could be fatal. We cannot let that happen.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Who Raj Is</h4>
                    <p>Before his diagnosis, Raj volunteered every Saturday at a local community center teaching underprivileged kids coding and computer skills. He believed technology could be a pathway out of poverty and dedicated his free time to helping others succeed.</p>
                    
                    <p>He's raising Maya alone after losing his wife to cancer three years ago. Despite his own health crisis, his primary concern is always Maya—making sure she has everything she needs, helping with homework, and being present for her school events even on dialysis days.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fw-semibold mt-4">We're so close—just $2,700 away from our goal! This funding will ensure Raj can continue his treatments without interruption while he waits for a kidney transplant. Every donation keeps him alive and keeps Maya from losing another parent.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-muted small mt-4">Thank you for taking the time to read Raj's story and for any support you can provide. Your generosity is literally saving his life and giving Maya hope for a future with her father.</p>
